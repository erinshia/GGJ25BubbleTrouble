## About
You play as Lui G, a bubble tea cup.  
You're chilling on the street in front of a bar, when suddenly a car of champagne bottles parks and hits you. They don't apologize, just look at you arrogantly and enter the bar. You want revenge.  
You then enter the bar, and seek to find them in the VIP area.
